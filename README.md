# CamelotInFlames
My first game made in Godot for a gamejam (GameDev.tv Jam 2024)

A simple platformer where you avoid a dragon's attacks while trying to stay
on a unique moving platform.

# Story
A dragon attacked Camelot and only a few magical bricks remains.
How long will you avoid the dragon's attack while remaining on 
the the last platform of a once proud castle, 
searching for its place in the ruins ?
